# POWR QA Playwright Tests - Project Requirements Document

## Project Overview
This project implements end-to-end tests using Playwright to validate the POWR.io platform functionality, with a focus on the pricing page and form builder functionality.

## Technical Environment
- **Framework**: Playwright
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Repository**: Public GitHub/GitLab repo
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README with setup and execution instructions
- **Success Criteria**: All tests must pass successfully

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pricing Page Validation
Verify that:
- The pricing page (https://powr.io/pricing) loads successfully
- Monthly pricing tiers match the expected values:
  * Free: $0
  * Starter: $4.94
  * Pro: $12.14
  * Business: $80.99
- Yearly pricing tiers match the expected values:
  * Free: $0
  * Starter: $5.49
  * Pro: $13.49
  * Business: $89.99

### Scenario 2: Form Builder Authentication Flow
Implement tests that:
- Record the authentication process in POWR.io
- Create a new form builder
- Select the "New Scratch" template
- Change the background color
- Publish the app
- Verify the live app (shared link) matches the standalone version

### Design Patterns
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Separating page interaction logic from test logic
- **SOLID Principles**: Following software design principles for maintainability
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Reusing code through POM and utility functions
- **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Balancing structure with simplicity

## Progress Tracking
